-- Notes: Do Surveys should both belong to a company but at the same time
-- Other companies should be able to browse public surveys for ideas
-- But companies should be able to have private Playbooks
-- Potential source of revenue is how many Playbooks a company can have,
-- Starts of public and then they are allowed a certain number of private playbooks

alter table users add column department_id uuid;

Questions for Rohan This morning:

Do we really need uuid's even though the core postgres database has no native suppport for them
and ORM's do not like them, I think we should be fine with big int

What are we doing with the database repo, should I move all database migrations into the database repo
and then run things from there

Think about how to do department names better as currently we will have a lot of duplicates
ex everyone has an Account Manager Position
